								<h2> The Airline Passenger Satisfaction Report<br />
										</a></h2>
								</a></h2>
								<p style="text-align:left;">in this project, data was collected from an Excel file that contained data on passenger satisfaction
									 for each month and class. The data was imported into Power BI and transformed to suit the project's needs.
									  Bar charts were created to visualize the satisfaction levels for each measure for three different classes.</p>
								
								<p style="text-align:left;">The Airline Passenger Satisfaction Report by Month project involved creating a monthly report on the satisfaction levels
									 of airline passengers across five measures: online booking, baggage handling, getting to location, flight service, seat comfort, and flight entertainment. The project also analyzed the satisfaction levels for three different classes: business class, economy class, and plus economy class.</p>
									 <img src="images/sat2.png" class="image fit"></a>
								<p style="text-align:left;">The report highlighted that "getting to location" is the measure with the lowest satisfaction 
									level across all classes and months, and that this area needs improvement</p>
								<img src="images/sat 3.png" class="image fit"></a>
								<p style="text-align:left;">In addition to the satisfaction levels, I also analyzed the overall performance of the airline,
									 including the number of incoming and outgoing flights, arrival delays, average departure flights by day,
									  and average arrival flights by day for each of the three different classes.
									   By taking a data-driven approach, airlines can make informed decisions to enhance their services and improve customer loyalty..</p>
								<img src="images/sat1.png" class="image fit"></a>
								<p style="text-align:left;">Overall, the airlines could improve their communication with passengers during 
									delays or cancellations, or invest in better transportation options to and from airports to address the issue of low satisfaction with "getting to location".</p>
